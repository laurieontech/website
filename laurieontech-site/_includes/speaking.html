    <h4>How to Talk Like an Engineer</h4>
    <p>It is often said that the hardest problem to solve is when two people are talking about different things but believe they are talking about the same thing. As you grow in your engineering career being able communicate about problems effectively is perhaps your single most important skill. This talk is about adding to a dictionary of common vocabulary. I'm here to arm you with the confidence and drive to revisit your technical communication skills and improve them.</p>
    <h4>A Software Engineer's Guide to DevOps</h4>
    <p>I'm a software engineer who spends her time writing code and developing apps. I have a pretty good grasp of the vocabulary and technologies relevant to my job. But what happens when another facet of engineering, one that is gaining a lot of traction and has a large footprint of its own starts becoming more and more relevant to my day to day tasks? Well, that's exactly what happened to me last year when DevOps became a big part of my role. This is my attempt to impart all of that knowledge onto you.</p>
    <h4>The Forever UI</h4>
    <p>How do you build a tool that can live forever? A tool that can evolve along with updates, and new hardware and ever changing technical specs? This talk is about a tool that does just that. What it does. How it works. And how we built it.</p>
    <h4>Building Tech for the Non-Technical</h4>
    <p>Everyone has blindspots. For developers it is often taking for granted certain technical skill sets. So what happens when you need to build a system for people without those skills? How do you adjust? What do you use as a reference point for common knowledge? How do you get out of your own head?</p>
    <h4>The Tablecloth Trick: Legacy Modernization Without User Process Disruption</h4>
    <p>Everyone has encountered a system that just had to be upgraded. But often that happens when users are used to the system and aren’t looking for a change. This is a series of stories for how companies have tried and failed and learned along the way. You’ll come away with some new pitfalls to avoid.</p>
